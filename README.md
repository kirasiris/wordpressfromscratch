A WordPress theme made with Bootstrap 4

First thing:
You need to put these files inside the desired folder in which you would like to save this theme.
I highly recommend you to name the folder with the same name that can be seen in the style.css file.

If you have correctly done that. Then the theme should be located at:
content>themes>FOLDER_NAME>ALL_OF_THESE_FILES
